# Security Policy

Rumba takes security seriously. This document explains how to report
vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Repository-Specific Issues

1. Go to the specific repository
2. Click the **Security** tab
3. Select **Report a vulnerability**
4. Fill out the form with details

GitHub's private vulnerability reporting keeps your report confidential until a
fix is available.

### What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (optional)

### For Third-Party Dependencies

Report security issues in dependencies directly to their maintainers.

## Our Response

When you report a security issue:

- We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We provide status updates as we investigate
- We credit reporters in security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)
- We coordinate disclosure timing with you

## Alternative Contact

For issues that cannot be reported through GitHub, or for coordinated
disclosure discussions:

- **Email**: <hello+security@rumba.id>

## Scope

This policy covers:

- The Rumba identity platform
- Official container images
- Documentation that could lead to security issues

Out of scope:

- Third-party integrations not maintained by us
- Issues in dependencies (report to upstream)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security

## Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to address issues before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying user data
- Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations and service disruption

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow these guidelines.
